      <description>Bubble sort How it works Compare two values and move the larger value to the right in each iteration. This way, the greatest value will end up on the right side in each iteration and will be locked and excluded from subsequent iterations.

Complexity Time O(n^2) bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, and it continues this process until the array is sorted.</description>

      <description>Index Does the order matter in a composite index? Yes!
For example, if there is an index on (uid, gid, pid),
the index will fully come into effect under the following cases:
uid = &amp;ldquo;AAA&amp;rdquo; uid = &amp;ldquo;AAA&amp;rdquo; AND gid = &amp;ldquo;BBB&amp;rdquo; uid = &amp;ldquo;AAA&amp;rdquo; AND gid = &amp;ldquo;BBB&amp;rdquo; AND pid = &amp;ldquo;CCC&amp;rdquo; the index will partially come into effect under the following cases:
uid = &amp;ldquo;AAA&amp;rdquo; AND pid = &amp;ldquo;CCC&amp;rdquo; only uid comes into effect in this index the index won&amp;rsquo;t come into effect under the following cases:</description>
