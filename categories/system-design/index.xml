      <description>How can you generate a key that is guaranteed to be unique? The possibility to get duplicates by UUIDv4 UUIDv4 generates a random id using random numbers, with 122 random bits. The chances of generating a duplicate are extremely low but not zero.
To understand the probability, consider that the number of version 4 UUIDs which can be generated is 2^122 or about 5.3x10^36.
To put these numbers into perspective, the annual risk of a given person being hit by a meteorite is estimated to be one chance in 17 billion , which means the probability is about 0.</description>
