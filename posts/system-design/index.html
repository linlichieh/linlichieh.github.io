<h3 id="the-possibility-to-get-duplicates-by-uuidv4">The possibility to get duplicates by UUIDv4</h3>
<p>UUIDv4 generates a random id using random numbers, with 122 random bits. The chances of generating a duplicate are extremely low but not zero.</p>
<p>To understand the probability, consider that the number of version 4 UUIDs which can be generated is <code>2^122</code> or about <code>5.3x10^36</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To put these numbers into perspective, the annual risk of a given person being hit by a meteorite is estimated to be one chance in 17 billion
, which means the probability is about <code>0.00000000006</code> (6 × 10−11), equivalent to the odds of creating a few tens of trillions of UUIDs in a year and having one duplicate.
In other words, only after generating 1 billion UUIDs every second for approximately 100 years would the probability of creating a single duplicate reach 50%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The approaches to improve the collision issue</p>
<ul>
<li>Combination of UUID and Timestamp or System-Specific Identifier
<ul>
<li>e.g. use timestamp as prefix or suffix to the UUID</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a Version 1 UUID (UUIDv1)
<ul>
<li>e.g. the MAC address of the host that generated the UUID and the current time</li>
<li>e.g. privacy concerns since MAC addresses can be traced back to the machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check Before Use
<ul>
<li>check whether it&rsquo;s been used before</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="another-method-to-ensure-the-generation-of-a-unique-key">Another method to ensure the generation of a unique key</h3>
<ul>
<li>Centralized ID Generation
<ul>
<li>Using a centralized server or database that generates and keeps track of IDs used can guarantee uniqueness.</li>
<li>This could involve using an auto-incrementing field in a database, or a dedicated service that generates unique IDs.</li>
<li>However, this approach might not be suitable for systems that need to generate IDs in a distributed or offline manner.</li>
<li>For example
<ul>
<li>generate all unique keys in advance (6 character long keys might be around 56.8 billion) in a table</li>
<li>once the key is used, then mark it by moving it to a separate table with appropriate locking in place</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distributed Consensus (solution to &ldquo;Centralized ID Generation&rdquo;)
<ul>
<li>In a distributed system where a centralized authority for ID generation isn&rsquo;t feasible, a consensus algorithm like Paxos or Raft could be used to agree on the next ID to use.</li>
<li>This requires more complexity and communication between nodes, but can guarantee uniqueness.</li>
</ul>
